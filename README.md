# Liftoff example — Pizza Blog Site

This is an example repo for [Liftoff – The Airtable CMS](https://www.github.com/postlight/liftoff), a tool by [Postlight](https://www.postlight.com) that lets you build static sites from content stored in an Airtable base.

This site highlights custom CSS as well as custom React renderers, including one that lets you copy and paste a Google Maps embed code into your Airtable row and see it on your webpage, and another that does the same for Spotify playlist links. To see this custom code, click [here](https://www.github.com/fdsimms/roni-rony-rone-liftoff-demo/custom).
